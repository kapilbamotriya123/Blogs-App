# Blogs-App
**Blog App (MERN Stack)**

Built my first full-stack app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This blog platform lets users create accounts, post blogs, and interact with others' content.

Key features: User authentication, blog creation/deletion, and a like system. Used React Router for multi-page navigation and native CSS for styling.

Main challenges: Implementing user-specific actions and managing state across components.

Key learnings: RESTful API development, CRUD operations, user authentication, and React state management. Gained solid understanding of full-stack development workflow.

The site is hosted on a free web service, so it may go idle after an hour of inactivity.in that case it might take up to 50 seconds to load, so there's no need for concern.
